Just a repo for http://a.teall.info/dice/
All credit for the code should go to him.

He has offered the code up for use and to make it a bit easier
I decided to try and document it's uses.  Also a starting point
for making whatever changes are nesscary.

Build the dice area
var box = new $t.dice.dice_box(canvas, { w: 500, h: 300 });

To adjust the canvas after the box has been initailzed.
box.reinit(canvas, { w: 500, h: 300 });
